    DYNAMIC LINK LIBRARY. RDPWrap Project Overview
========================================================================

This RDPWrap DLL library was automatically created using the application wizard.

This file contains a summary of the contents of all files that make up the RDPWrap application.


RDPWrap.vcxproj
    This is the main VC++ project file created by the application wizard. It contains information about the version of Visual C++ used to create the file, as well as information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected by the application wizard.

RDPWrap.vcxproj.filters
    This is the VC++ project filters file created by the application wizard. It contains information about the mappings between files in your project and filters. These mappings are used in the IDE environment to group files with the same extensions under a single node (for example, CPP files are mapped to the "Source Files" filter).

RDPWrap.cpp
    Main DLL source file.

	Symbols are not exported when creating this DLL library. Therefore, a LIB file is not created when building it. If this project needs to define a dependency on another project, you must add code to export symbols from the DLL to ensure the creation of an export library, or set the "Yes" value for the "Ignore Input Library" property on the General Properties page of the "Linker" folder in the "Project Properties" dialog.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file named RDPWrap.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other notes.

The "TODO:" comments in the application wizard indicate fragments of source code that need to be supplemented or modified.
